Double Entry Accounting for Rails Applications

## Account Types, Debits and Credits

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debits_and_credits>

In Double Entry Accounting there are 5 account types: Asset, Liability, Income,
Expense and Equity.

In each transaction, sources are credited and destinations are debited.

Debit and Credit affect balance of an account differently depending on the
account type.

For Asset and Expense accounts, Debit increases the balance, and Credit
decreases it. For the rest of the accounts it is the opposite. i.e. Debit
decreases and Credit increases the balance.
